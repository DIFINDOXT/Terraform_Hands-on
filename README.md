# Terraform Hands-on

Small, recruiter-friendly Terraform practice repo. Each day adds a tiny, focused exercise (EC2 basics, multi-region, modules, etc.) with code + short notes. No secrets are stored in this repo.

## What’s inside
- `day-01-ec2-basic/` — minimal EC2 example scaffold (you’ll add code)
- `media/` — screenshots or short screen recordings (trim/mask creds)

## Goals
- Show practical Terraform skills, module usage, and safe workflows
- Keep changes small and readable for quick review

## Security & privacy (important)
- Never commit AWS keys, tokens, or `*.tfvars` with secrets
- Mask terminal and cloud console while recording
- Use env vars or a local, git-ignored `*.tfvars` for sensitive values

## Media notes
- You can commit short MP4s/GIFs in `media/` (keep sizes small). 
  For longer videos, upload to X/Twitter or elsewhere and link from Day notes.
